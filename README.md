# [Project 1: Data Science House Price Prediction](https://github.com/endif1/King_County_House_Price_Predict)
* Created tool that estimates house price at King County
* Analyzing features that affect house prices
* Creating map using folium to re categorized house based on price
* Creating base model with few machine learning algorithm (Linear Regression, XGB Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest)
* Hypertuning model and optimized them with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV

# [Project 3: Data Science Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction](https://github.com/endif1/Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction-)
* In this case we will build a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance
* Binning, change value data so it can be use for Visualization
* Analyzing features that affect Response customer
* Encode categorical values using Pandas .map function
* Apllying the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to the minority target since the data is Imbalance
* Creating base model with few machine learning algorithm (Linear Regression, XGB Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest)
* Hypertuning model and optimized them with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
